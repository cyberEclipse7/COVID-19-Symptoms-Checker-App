# COVID-19 Symptoms Checker App

Problem: 

COVID-19 is a novice virus, and people are not aware whether they have the virus or not becasue on average it takes about 5–6 days for the virus to show the symptoms. So people have to visit the hospital to confirm if they have the virus or not which is not safe, as it is very risky to visit the hospital these days with increasing number of cases of the covid-19 virus being reported. So what can the people do? 

Solution: 

We have built an app using the Microsoft PowerApps for the local health center to share with the local public, so they can check their symptoms by logging into this app. So a local doctor can check the patient's symptoms and confirm if the condition is critical and if it is necessary for the patient to come to the hospital or not. This way most people may not have to visit the hospital and avoid the risk of being infected with the COVID-19 virus. This also helps the local doctor manage and prioritze the most vulnerable patients.
